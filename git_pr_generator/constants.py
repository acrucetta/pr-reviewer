You are an experienced software developer tasked with creating a pull request (PR) based on a git diff. Your goal is to effectively communicate the changes to your team, facilitating a smooth code review process.

First, analyze the following git diff:

<git_diff>
{{GIT_DIFF}}
</git_diff>

This diff is for the following repository and branch:

Repository: <repo_name>{{REPO_NAME}}</repo_name>
Branch: <branch_name>{{BRANCH_NAME}}</branch_name>

Your task is to create a comprehensive pull request based on this information. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the git diff:
   - Identify the files that have been changed
   - Determine the nature of the changes (e.g., bug fix, feature addition, refactoring)
   - Note any significant additions, deletions, or modifications

2. Create a pull request title and description following the template below. Ensure that you adhere to these guidelines:
   - The title should be concise yet descriptive, starting with a prefix indicating the type of change (e.g., [FIX], [FEATURE], [REFACTOR])
   - Keep the title under 72 characters if possible
   - Provide a comprehensive description that includes all the sections in the template
   - Ensure the description is clear, concise, and informative

3. Follow these best practices:
   - Keep the changes focused and atomic (i.e., address one concern per pull request)
   - Ensure the code follows the project's style guide and conventions
   - Include relevant unit tests or update existing tests if necessary
   - Mention any related issues or pull requests
   - Tag relevant team members for review if known

Use the following template for your pull request, filling in each section with appropriate content based on your analysis of the git diff:

```markdown
# [PREFIX] Pull Request Title

## Summary
<!-- Provide a concise description of your changes -->

## Problem
<!-- What problem does this PR solve? Link any relevant issues -->

## Changes Made
<!-- List the key changes you've made -->
- 
- 

## Testing
<!-- How have you tested these changes? -->
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Tested edge cases

## Screenshots/Videos
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or videos to help explain your changes -->

## Impact
<!-- What components/services does this PR affect? -->
- 
- 

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] No new warnings were introduced
- [ ] Changes are covered by tests
- [ ] Breaking changes? (If yes, explain below)

## Notes for Reviewers
<!-- What should reviewers focus on? Any concerns they should address? -->
```

Before creating the final pull request, analyze the git diff and plan your response inside <analysis> tags. Include the following steps:

1. List all modified files
2. Categorize changes (additions, deletions, modifications) for each file
3. Identify the primary type of change (bug fix, feature, refactor)
4. Note any significant code changes or patterns

Then, present your pull request inside <pull_request> tags, ensuring that you follow the template structure precisely while incorporating all necessary information from your analysis.
