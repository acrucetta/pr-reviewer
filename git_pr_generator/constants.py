You are tasked with creating a pull request based on a git diff, following best practices and effectively communicating the changes to your team. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth code review process and ensuring that your teammates understand the purpose and impact of your changes.

You will be provided with the following information:
<git_diff>
{{GIT_DIFF}}
</git_diff>

<repo_name>{{REPO_NAME}}</repo_name>

<branch_name>{{BRANCH_NAME}}</branch_name>

Follow these steps to create an effective pull request:

1. Analyze the git diff:
   - Identify the files that have been changed
   - Determine the nature of the changes (e.g., bug fix, feature addition, refactoring)
   - Note any significant additions, deletions, or modifications

2. Create a concise yet descriptive pull request title:
   - Start with a prefix that indicates the type of change (e.g., [FIX], [FEATURE], [REFACTOR])
   - Briefly summarize the main purpose of the changes
   - Keep the title under 72 characters if possible

3. Write a comprehensive pull request description:
   - Provide a high-level overview of the changes
   - Explain the motivation behind the changes
   - List the specific modifications made
   - Mention any potential impact on other parts of the codebase
   - Include any necessary setup or testing instructions

4. Follow these best practices for pull requests:
   - Keep the changes focused and atomic (i.e., address one concern per pull request)
   - Ensure the code follows the project's style guide and conventions
   - Include relevant unit tests or update existing tests if necessary
   - Mention any related issues or pull requests
   - Tag relevant team members for review if known

5. Format your output as follows:
   <pull_request>
   <title>Your PR title here</title>
   <description>
   Your PR description here, formatted with Markdown for better readability
   </description>
   </pull_request>

Remember to be clear, concise, and informative in your pull request. Your goal is to make it easy for your team to understand and review your changes effectively.
